(a) Describe the relationship between height and weight.
There is a positive linear relationship between height and weight. As height increases, weight also tends to increase. The scatterplot shows that taller individuals generally weigh more.



(b) Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
Regression Equation:

Weight= ‚àí105.0113 + 1.0176 √ó Height

Interpretation:

Slope (1.0176): For every 1 cm increase in height, the weight increases by approximately 1.02 kg, on average.

Intercept (-105.0113): When height is 0 cm, the predicted weight is -105.01 kg. This doesn't make practical sense (you can‚Äôt have 0 cm height), so it just serves as a mathematical anchor for the line, not a real-world estimate.



(c) Do the data provide strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase in weight?
Hypotheses:

Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 0 (Height is not associated with weight)

Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): Œ≤‚ÇÅ ‚â† 0 (Height is associated with weight)

From the table:

p-value for height = 0.0000

Since the p-value is extremely small (less than 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion: Yes, there is strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase in weight.



(d) The correlation coefficient for height and weight is 0.72. Calculate R¬≤ and interpret it in context.
ùëÖ2= 0.72^2= 0.5184
 About 51.84% of the variability in weight can be explained by height using the linear model. This means height is a moderately strong predictor of weight for these individuals.
