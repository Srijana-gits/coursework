#Question 10.1.

In Subsection 10.3.2 we compare the average against the mid
range as estimators of the expectation of the measurement. The goal of this
 exercise is to repeat the analysis, but this time compare the average to the
 median as estimators of the expectation in symmetric distributions.

 1. Simulate the sampling distribution of average and the median of a sample
 of size n = 100 from the Normal(32) distribution. Compute the expec
tation and the variance of the sample average and of the sample median.
 Which of the two estimators has a smaller mean square error?
 
 ```{r}
mu <- 3
sig <- sqrt(2)
X.bar <- rep(0, 10^5)
X.med <- rep(0, 10^5)

for (i in 1:10^5) {
  X <- rnorm(100, mu, sig)
  X.bar[i] <- mean(X)
  X.med[i] <- median(X)
}

mean(X.bar) # 3.000010
mean(X.med) # 3.000086
var(X.bar) # 0.0201
var(X.med) # 0.0312
```
Both estimators are unbiased: their averages ≈ 3
But sample mean has smaller variance

The sample mean has a smaller MSE, so it is better than the median for estimating the mean of a Normal distribution.


 2. Simulate the sampling distribution of average and the median of a sample
 of size n = 100 from the Uniform(0555) distribution. Compute the
 expectation and the variance of the sample average and of the sample
 median. Which of the two estimators has a smaller mean square error?

 ```{r}
X.bar <- rep(0, 10^5)
X.med <- rep(0, 10^5)

for (i in 1:10^5) {
  X <- runif(100, min = 0.5, max = 5.5)
  X.bar[i] <- mean(X)
  X.med[i] <- median(X)
}

mean(X.bar) # 3.000941
mean(X.med) # 3.001162
var(X.bar) # 0.0209
var(X.med) # 0.0607
 ```
 
Again, both estimators are unbiased but the sample mean has a much smaller variance.
The sample mean is again better than the median for estimating the mean in a Uniform distribution too.

#Question 10.2.
 
The goal in this exercise is to assess estimation of a proportion
 in a population on the basis of the proportion in the sample.
 The file pop2.csv was introduced in Exercise 7.1 of Chapter 7. This file
 contains information associated to the blood pressure of an imaginary popu
lation of size 100,000. The file can be found on the internet (http://pluto.
 huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets/pop2.csv). One of the variables in
 the file is a factor by the name group that identi es levels of blood pressure.
 The levels of this variable are HIGH , LOW , and NORMAL .
 The file ex2.csv contains a sample of size n = 150 taken from the given
 population. This le can also be found on the internet (http://pluto.huji.
 ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets/ex2.csv). It contains the same variables
 as in the file pop2.csv . The file ex2.csv corresponds in this exercise to
 the observed sample and the file pop2.csv corresponds to the unobserved
 population.
 Download both files to your computer and answer the following questions:

 1. Compute the proportion in the sample of those with a high level of blood
 pressure16.

 ```{r}
ex2 <- read.csv("C:/Users/ds3/Documents/coursework/week2/ex2.csv")
mean(ex2$group == "HIGH")
 ```
 Sample proportion = 0.2467

 
 2. Compute the proportion in the population of those with a high level of
blood pressure.
```{r}
pop2 <- read.csv("C:/Users/ds3/Documents/coursework/week2/pop2.csv")
mean(pop2$group == "HIGH")
```
 Population proportion = 0.2813


 3. Simulate the sampling distribution of the sample proportion and compute
 its expectation.
```{r}
P.hat <- rep(0, 10^5)
for (i in 1:10^5) {
  X <- sample(pop2$group, 150)
  P.hat[i] <- mean(X == "HIGH")
}
mean(P.hat)
```
 Expected value of sample proportion = 0.2812
 Close to true population proportion (0.2813) → estimator is unbiased.


4. Compute the variance of the sample proportion.

```{r}
var(P.hat)
```
 Sample variance ≈ 0.00135
 
 
 5. It is proposed in Section 10.5 that the variance of the sample proportion
 is Var(P) = p(1 -p)/ n, where p is the probability of the event (having a
 high blood pressure in our case) and n is the sample size (n = 150 in our
 case). Examine this proposal in the current setting.

 ```{r}
p <- mean(pop2$group == "HIGH")
p * (1 - p) / 150
 ```
Theoretical variance ≈ 0.00135, which matches the simulation.

#Question 9.1.
 
  The data for the 50 patients is stored in file magnets.csv .
 The file can be found on the internet at http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/
 StatThink/Datasets/magnets.csv. Download this file to your computer and
 store it in the working directory of R. Read the content of the file into an R data
 frame. Produce a summary of the content of the data frame and answer the
 following questions:


 1. What is the sample average of the change in score between the patients
 rating before the application of the device and the rating after the appli
cation?

```{r}
magnets <- read.csv("C:/Users/ds3/Documents/coursework/week2/magnets.csv")
summary(magnets)
````

 2. Is the variable active a factor or a numeric variable?

```{r}
str(magnets$active)
````
# The variable active is a factor.

 3. Compute the average value of the variable change for the patients that
 received and active magnet and average value for those that received an
 inactive placebo. (Hint: Notice that the rst 29 patients received an active
 magnet and the last 21 patients received an inactive placebo. The sub
sequence of the rst 29 values of the given variables can be obtained via
 the expression change[1:29] and the last 21 vales are obtained via the
 expression change[30:50] .)

```{r}
mean(magnets$change[1:29])
mean(magnets$change[30:50])
```

 4. Compute the sample standard deviation of the variable change for the
 patients that received and active magnet and the sample standard devia
tion for those that received an inactive placebo.
```{r}
sd(magnets$change[1:29])
sd(magnets$change[30:50])
```

 5. Produce a boxplot of the variable change for the patients that received
 and active magnet and for patients that received an inactive placebo.
 What is the number of outliers in each subsequence?
```{r}
boxplot(magnets$change[1:29])
# no outliers
boxplot(magnets$change[30:50])
# in the plot we can see that the values 3,4 and 5 are outliers

table(magnets$change[30:50])
# datawise, there are 4 outliers
```

  X2.bar <- mean(X2)
  X1.var <- var(X1)
  X2.var <- var(X2)
  test.stat[i] <- (X1.bar - X2.bar) / sqrt(X1.var / 29 + X2.var / 21)
}

quantile(test.stat, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

Does the observedvalue of the statistic, computed for thedata frame
 magnets , falls inside or outside of the interval that iscomputed in 1?

```{r}
x1.bar <- mean(magnets$change[1:29])
x2.bar <- mean(magnets$change[30:50])
x1.var <- var(magnets$change[1:29])
x2.var <- var(magnets$change[30:50])

(x1.bar - x2.bar) / sqrt(x1.var / 29 + x2.var / 21)
```

#The value is  5.985601 and it does not belong to the interval.
